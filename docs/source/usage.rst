Usage
=====

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

To use VueQueue, it is as easy as installing the application on your phone using the ``Google Play Store`` or the ``Apple App Store``, and registering a new account!

Joining Queues
----------------

To join a queue, log into the application and join a queue provided by an organisation that supports VueQueue:

The ``Queue`` should be either ``active`` or ``inactive``.
If it is inactive, the application will throw an error message informing 
the user about the situation.

.. autoexception:: lumache.InvalidKindError

For example:

>>> Launch Application
>>> Find the desired Queue
>>> Press the button
>>> Join Queue
