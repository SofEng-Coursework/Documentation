Problems
=========

This documentation addresses the compatibility issues encountered while using Firebase Auth and Cloud Firestore testing packages in a Flutter application testing environment. Testing is a crucial phase in software development, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the application. However, compatibility issues can arise, causing delays and hindering the testing process.

Issue Description:
-------------------
The packages on't have the same level of validation that we want.

Impact:
-------
Testing Delays: 

The compatibility issues resulted in delays in the testing process, prolonging the time required to validate the application's functionality.
Developers spent additional time troubleshooting compatibility issues instead of focusing on writing and executing test cases.
Risk of Unreliable Results: Inaccurate test results due to compatibility issues raised concerns about the reliability of the testing process and the application's overall quality.

Root Cause Analysis:
---------------------
The testing packages were not a good fit for our application because they might not provide accurate enough results.

Resolution Steps:
-----------------
Testing Environment Setup:

Standardize the testing environment across development machines to minimize platform-specific differences that could affect compatibility.
Consider using continuous integration pipelines to automate the testing process in a controlled and consistent environment.

Community Support:

Seek assistance from the Flutter and Firebase developer communities to identify common compatibility issues and potential workarounds or solutions.
Contribute to open-source projects and provide feedback to help improve the compatibility and reliability of Firebase testing packages for Flutter applications.

Compatibility issues with Firebase Auth and Cloud Firestore testing packages can present challenges during the testing phase of Flutter 
application development. By understanding the root causes and implementing appropriate resolution steps, developers can overcome these 
issues and ensure a smoother testing process. Collaboration within the developer community and active engagement with Firebase and Flutter 
documentation are essential for addressing compatibility issues effectively and improving the overall reliability of testing packages.
